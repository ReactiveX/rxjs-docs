    description: `
      <p>Returns a mirrored Observable of the source Observable,
      but modified so that the provided Observer is called to perform a side effect for every
      value, error, and completion emitted by the source. Any errors that are thrown in
      the aforementioned Observer or handlers are safely sent down the error path
      of the output Observable.
      </p>
      <p>
      This operator is useful for debugging your Observables for the correct values
      or performing other side effects.
      </p>
      <p>
      Note: this is different to a <span class="markdown-code">subscribe</span> on the Observable. If the Observable
      returned by <span class="markdown-code">do</span> is not subscribed, the side effects specified by the
      Observer will never happen. <span class="markdown-code">do</span> therefore simply spies on existing
      execution, it does not trigger an execution to happen like <span class="markdown-code">subscribe</span> does.</p>
