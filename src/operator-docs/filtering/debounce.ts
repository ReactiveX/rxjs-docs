  walkthrough: {
    description: `
      <p>
        debounce delays values emitted by the source Observable,
        but drops previous pending delayed emissions if a new value arrives on the source Observable.
        This operator keeps track of the most recent value from the source Observable,
        and spawns a duration Observable by calling the durationSelector function.
        The value is emitted only when the duration Observable emits a value or completes,
        and if no other value was emitted on the source Observable since the duration Observable was spawned.
        If a new value appears before the duration Observable emits,
        the previous value will be dropped and will not be emitted on the output Observable.
      </p>
      <p>
      Like debounceTime, this is a rate-limiting operator, and also a delay-like operator
      since output emissions do not necessarily occur at the same time as they did on the source Observable.
      </p>
