      <p>
      <span class="markdown-code">debounceTime</span> delays values emitted by the source Observable, but drops
      previous pending delayed emissions if a new value arrives on the source
      Observable. This operator keeps track of the most recent value from the
      source Observable, and emits that only when <span class="markdown-code">dueTime</span> enough time has passed
      without any other value appearing on the source Observable. If a new value
      appears before <span class="markdown-code">dueTime</span> silence occurs, the previous value will be dropped
      and will not be emitted on the output Observable.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is a rate-limiting operator, because it is impossible for more than one
        value to be emitted in any time window of duration <span class="markdown-code">dueTime</span>, but it is also
        a delay-like operator since output emissions do not occur at the same time as
        they did on the source Observable. Optionally takes a <span class="markdown-code">IScheduler</span> for
        managing timers.
