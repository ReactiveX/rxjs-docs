## Building/Testing

The build and test structure is fairly primitive at the moment. There are various npm scripts that can be run:

- start: runs the dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
- test: runs tests with `jasmine`, must have built prior to running.
- build: build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory
- build-prod: builds for production using the `--prod` flag
- commit: runs git commit wizard for passing rxjs-github-bot message validator

## Committing
It is strongly recommended that when creating a commit, you follow this procedure to start the commit wizard. It will aid you on creating valid commit messages.

```shell
git add .
npm run commit
```
